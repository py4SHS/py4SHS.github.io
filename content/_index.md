 The aim of this summer school is to provide researchers, doctoral candidates and master's students in the humanities and social sciences with a practical basis for enhancing their research through the contribution of digital sciences: the training will combine an introduction to the Python language, the use of artificial intelligence, automatic language processing applied to textual data or images, and the basics of digital project management. In addition to theoretical instruction in the mornings, the afternoons will be devoted to practical work.
